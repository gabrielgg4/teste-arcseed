		  <h2>Recharging RPs</h2>

		  <p>You can recharge your render points in your Dashboard under your Subscription Settings <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcseedai.com/Dashboard">here</a></strong> once you are logged in.
		  <br>you can add or remove RPs by clicking on the + or - Signs. After you picked how many RPs you want just click on Add to be taken to the payment platform and finish your transaction, after the payment is processed the resources will be added to your account.
		  <br>There is always a minimum ammount of points to add depending on wich Subscription Plan you picked. We have the minimum value because we need to pay a high percentage of the value to the server and for the payment platform but after the minimum you can add RPs in ammounts of 100 up to the ammount you need.</p>
		  <li>Enthusiast : minimum of 100 points</li>
		  <li>Professional : minimum of 300 points  </li>
		  <li>Enterprise : minimum of 1000 points</li>

		<!-- Precision
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_color_schemes">
          <h2>Precision</h2>
          <p>There are two precision levels to render with, the <strong>Standard</strong> and the <strong>Professional</strong>.</P>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Standard</code> - Requires less RPs to render but generates smaller and a little less precise images.</li>
			<a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/Standard_Example.webp">
			<img src="assets/images/Standard_Example_sc.webp" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" alt="image">

		  <p> <strong>OBS</strong> : Keep in mind that the enhance in quality from standard to professional may vary, since the AI is trying to create a new image on top of the other it may change a few details of it.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">We would like to ask you all to try to keep the peace and be respectful to other users. On all of our comunities or servers, try not to offend, use swearings or other offensive  therms, try not to get into political slurring, we don't mind debating but as long as its healthy and not ofensive.<br> That said:
		  </p>
		  <li> Be kind and respect each other, if you are an advanced user don't create disrespectful or agressive imagery. Harassment won't be tolerated.</li>
		  <br>
		  <li> If you are an advanced user don't create adult content or violent images if you are an advanced user. Premium users can hide their content by making the renderings private, if you intent to make tests of NSFW images (wich are forbideen) always hide the content from others, if you forget and the image end up on the public gallery your account can be banned and you can face legal repercussions by any ofended member of the community.</li>
		  <br>
		  <li> We don't want to block functionalities or add censorship to our tools like most of the other generative tools do, we just ask for you to be careful and respect the other users.</li>

		============================ -->
		<section id="idocs_genpages">
		  <h2>Render Pages</h2>
		  <p class="text-4">The Render Pages are the most important parts of our platform, on them you can perform different rendering tasks on each of the available pages, keep in mind that every page has a slightly different layout.
		  <br>To access the render pages you will need to be first logged in, then click on the
		  <br>The pages being:</p>
		  <hr>
		  <li> <Strong>Brainstorm Gen</strong>: In this page you can render images from basic input choices like the type of creationg, what it is, the weather, etc..., this tool is perfect for brainstorming ideas or concepts fast.</li><br>
		  <li> <Strong>Sketch 2 Render</strong>: In this page you can render images from image inputs, the images can be a screenshot of your 3D software, a hand drawn sketch, a picture of an under construction building, etc... You can create an infinite ammount of designs or possibilities, facilitating and speeding up the overall creative process.</li><br>
		  <li> <Strong>Canvas Alchemy</strong>: This is an artistic rendering tool, add a style image that can be a famous paiting, an incredible landscape, a logo, etc... and our tool will try to recreate the environement with that style. This tool tries to imagine possibilities, it is perfect for instagram posts or to gift your clients with amazing unique designs from creations you deliver.</li><br>
		  <li> <Strong>Re-render</strong>: With Re-render you can take an old render and give the AI to process it and make it more realistic and harmonic. This tool is perfect to increase the quality of any 3D rendering you made and bring it to the a high level standard.</li><br>
		  <li> <Strong>Redecorate(beta)</strong>: Redecorate is still in Beta stage, but what it does is to take an empty space from an uploaded image and decorate it extremely fast.</li><br>
		  <li> <Strong>Refining Tool</strong>: The refining tool increases the size and quality of any images you created making the beautiful renders you do even more incredible.</li>

		<!-- Overview
		============================ -->
		<section id="idocs_overview">
		  <h2>Overview</h2>
		  <p class="text-4"> The render pages are very similar between them to make the process simplified, most of them will be presented with 4 steps before rendering, these steps are not visualy represented in the pages, they are more like an idea of flow of creationg.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <li>First step: the first steps will often be related to choose an input image or format to start the generation with, followed by picking the mode, seed and if you are creating exteriors or interiors.</li><br>
		  <li>Second step: the second step will define What are you creating, after choosing what you can click on customization to create variations to your final render.</li><br>
		  <li>Third step: the Third Step is the finetunning step, here you will change the aspects in wich the AI will render the images, its the most complex part of the generation and requires lots of testing in order to reach better results but we will talk more about it later on its own section.</li><br>
		  <li>The Final step: Now choose the visibility (if your image will be available on the public gallery or on your own private gallery) and the precision of the image, and once you chose those or used the defaults just press render to start the process.</li><br>
		  <li><Strong>OBS : Remember you don't need to use all the steps to create a rendering, for that you only need to pick the initial step and define what you want to create on the second</strong></li>
		  <hr>
		  <p>Bellow you can see on the image the representation of these steps divisions on the Brainstorm Gen page, keep in mind that each tool has a slightly different look specially on the format or cropping áreas and on the fine-tuning areas, the first step comprehends the image format or cropping tool, the selection of modes, the seed and type, the second what are you creating and the special customizations, the third the finetuning of the AI and the fourth and final step the visibility, precision and the render button.</p>

			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_strenght.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>You can chose three values to it</li>
			<ul><li>Creative : Gives more freedom to the AI to imagine, it tends to follow slightly less of the input image.</li>
			<li>Balanced : Balances creativity but tries to keep the shapes correct.</li>
			<li>Precise : Tries to follow the shapes without being much creative.</li></ul>
			<hr>
			
			<img src="assets/images/generative/\sketch2render/Shape_strenght.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>keep in mind that the fine-tune sliders will influentiate one another,  The finetune exposure is closely related to the strenght, because of that, for better results try to combine both.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><code>Shape Exposure</code> : The Shape Exposure represents for <strong>how long</strong> the AI will try to keep the Shape Strenght. This one is a bit tricky to understand, but think this way, the Shape Strenght controls how strong the shapes will be held during the render and the Shape Exposure is how much of the render time the AI will be holding this shape. It appears on the exterior and interior tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>Ex : if the render time is one minute and we have three options, <strong>soft</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong> and <strong>strong</strong>, the soft will keep the shape strenght running for 25% of the render, the moderate 50% and the strong 80%, this means that you can combine a higher strenght with a low exposure if your results are not getting as you need, or vice-versa.
			<br>There are three values to choose:</li>
			<ul><li>Soft : Runs the Shape Strenght for 25% of the total render time.</li>
			<li>Moderate : Runs the Shape Strenght for 50% of the render time.</li>
			<li>Strong :  Runs the Shape Strenght for 80% of the render time.</li></ul>

			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>We don't use 100% of exposure because our model does not showed increased results with it, but soon you will be able to change these values more freely on the Pro editor.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Input Depth</code> : The input depth takes the depth information of the image and use it to control the shape of objects on the scene. It appears only on the Exterior tool.

			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_input.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

			<li>Shalow : Uses 30% of the depth information on the render.</li>
			<li>Balanced : Uses 60% of the depth information on the render.</li>

			<img src="assets/images/generative/\sketch2render/skt2r_input.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Contour Strenght</code> : The countour strenght traces lines around the corners of the objects on the image, these lines then are taken as guides to create the render, the stronguer this is, more it will follow. It appears only on the Exterior tool.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_input.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

            <h3>Fine-Tuning</h3>
            <p class="text-4">Fine-tunes are the most advanced tools to modify your rendering, the can perform minimal changes to enhance the image or completely change it, each tool has a different set of fine-tuning options.
			<br>You don't need to change any of these settings to reach good quality images, but they may improve a lot the final render if you know what you are doing.
			<br>The sketch 2 Render has different sets of sliders if you choose Interiors or Exteriors:</p>
			
			<li><code>AI Imagination</code> : The AI Imagination fine-tune adjusts the attention of the AI to your choices, higher values will make the AI be more focused while lower values will let the AI wonder more.<br>Keep in mind that low values can be foggy while higher values can look more contrasting. It appears on the simple and advanced tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_imagination.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>In the end is a matter of choice and testing, there is no right answer here.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Brainstorm_gen/BSgen_imagination.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<hr>
			
			
			<li><code>Shape Strenght</code> : The Shape Strenght represents <strong>how much</strong> the AI will be attentive to the shapes of the input image(the image you uploaded).It appears only on the Advanced tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_strenght.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>You can chose three values to it</li>
			<ul><li>Creative : Gives more freedom to the AI to imagine, it tends to follow slightly less of the input image.</li>
			<li>Balanced : Balances creativity but tries to keep the shapes correct.</li>
			<li>Precise : Tries to follow the shapes without being much creative.</li></ul>
			<hr>
			
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Canvas_alchemy/ca_shape_strenght.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>keep in mind that the fine-tune sliders will influentiate one another,  The finetune exposure is closely related to the strenght, because of that, for better results try to combine both.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><code>Shape Exposure</code> : The Shape Exposure represents for <strong>how long</strong> the AI will try to keep the Shape Strenght. This one is a bit tricky to understand, but think this way, the Shape Strenght controls how strong the shapes will be held during the render and the Shape Exposure is how much of the render time the AI will be holding this shape. It appears only in advanced tools. The changes in results are mild in this case, but they can help fixing minor issues.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>Ex : if the render time is one minute and we have three options, <strong>soft</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong> and <strong>strong</strong>, the soft will keep the shape strenght running for 25% of the render, the moderate 50% and the strong 80%, this means that you can combine a higher strenght with a low exposure if your results are not getting as you need, or vice-versa.
			<br>There are three values to choose:</li>
			<ul><li>Soft : Runs the Shape Strenght for 25% of the total render time.</li>
			<li>Moderate : Runs the Shape Strenght for 50% of the render time.</li>
			<li>Strong :  Runs the Shape Strenght for 80% of the render time.</li></ul>
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Canvas_alchemy/ca_shape_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>We don't use 100% of exposure because our model does not showed increased results with it, but soon you will be able to change these values more freely on the Pro editor.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Style Transfer</code> : The Style transfer represents how much of the style the AI will use while generating the image. Strong values will bring more of the original style to the render while weak values will soft the stylization. It appears on the simple and advanced tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/Style_transfer.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>On the gif below you can see the influence of the Style Transfer from weak to Strong.</li>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Canvas_alchemy/Style_transfer.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Style Exposure</code> : This value represents <strong> for how long</strong> the style transfer will last, weaker values will take only a small part of the rendering process to change the style of the final image while stronger values will use the whole rendering process to change the style. It appears on the simple and advanced tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/Style_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>Ex : if the render time is one minute the weak will keep the stylizing process running for 20% of the render and the strong for 100%.
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Canvas_alchemy/ca_style_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Originality</code> : The Originality represents how much of the input image to receive the style will change on the rendering process. It appears only on the advanced tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/originality.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>If the value is the minimum the image won't change, if it is on the highest it will change completely. On the Gif below you can see how low values barely change the image while with higher values the render absorbs completely the style.</li>

            <p class="text-4">Still under the Customizations tab you have the Color Palette picker, here you can infer to the render colors to set up a color palette to your scene.
			<br>Keep in mind that we are dealing with a neural network and it may not follow completely your direction, think of it as a hint.
			<br>Be aware that if you use the Color Palette Picker and also add Materials to your render, the results may inlfuentiate on each other.</p>
			<li>You can choose up to three colors for your color palette, but you don't need to add any color palette to your project if you don't want.</li>

			<br>Keep in mind that we are dealing with a neural network and it may not follow completely your direction, think of it as a hint, its also advisable to not use all three material possibilities in order to keep the final image stable.
			<br>Be aware that if you use the Color Palette Picker and also add Materials to your render, the results may inlfuentiate one another.
			<br>You don't need to use any materials in your render if you don't want to, you can leave the AI to add these for you.</p>

		 <!-- redecorate Finetunning
		  ============================ -->
          <section id="idocs_redfinetuning">
            <h3>Fine-Tuning</h3>
            <p class="text-4">Fine-tunes are the most advanced tools to modify your rendering, the can perform minimal changes to enhance the image or completely change it, each tool has a different set of fine-tuning options.
			<br>You don't need to change any of these settings to reach good quality images, but they may improve a lot the final render if you know what you are doing.</p>
			
			
			<li><code>AI Imagination</code> : The AI Imagination fine-tune adjusts the attention of the AI to your choices, higher values will make the AI be more focused while lower values will let the AI wonder more.<br>Keep in mind that low values can be foggy while higher values can look more contrasting. It appears on the exterior and interior tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_imagination.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>In the end is a matter of choice and testing, there is no right answer here.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Brainstorm_gen/BSgen_imagination.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<hr>
			
			
			<li><code>Shape Strenght</code> : The Shape Strenght represents <strong>how much</strong> the AI will be attentive to the shapes of the input image(the image you uploaded).It appears only on the interiors.<li>
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_strenght.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>You can chose three values to it</li>
			<ul><li>Creative : Gives more freedom to the AI to imagine, it tends to follow slightly less of the input image.</li>
			<li>Balanced : Balances creativity but tries to keep the shapes correct.</li>
			<li>Precise : Tries to follow the shapes without being much creative.</li></ul>
			<hr>
			
			<img src="assets/images/generative/\sketch2render/Shape_strenght.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>keep in mind that the fine-tune sliders will influentiate one another,  The finetune exposure is closely related to the strenght, because of that, for better results try to combine both.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Shape Exposure</code> : The Shape Exposure represents for <strong>how long</strong> the AI will try to keep the Shape Strenght. This one is a bit tricky to understand, but think this way, the Shape Strenght controls how strong the shapes will be held during the render and the Shape Exposure is how much of the render time the AI will be holding this shape. It appears on the exterior and interior tools.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/AI_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>Ex : if the render time is one minute and we have three options, <strong>soft</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong> and <strong>strong</strong>, the soft will keep the shape strenght running for 25% of the render, the moderate 50% and the strong 80%, this means that you can combine a higher strenght with a low exposure if your results are not getting as you need, or vice-versa.
			<br>There are three values to choose:</li>
			<ul><li>Soft : Runs the Shape Strenght for 25% of the total render time.</li>
			<li>Moderate : Runs the Shape Strenght for 50% of the render time.</li>
			<li>Strong :  Runs the Shape Strenght for 80% of the render time.</li></ul>
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/sketch2render/Shape_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>We don't use 100% of exposure because our model does not showed increased results with it, but soon you will be able to change these values more freely on the Pro editor.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Room Weight</code> : The Room Weight fine-tune tries to keep more of the original look of the room in the image, if you want more change try nulifying this value. As most of the parameters on the Re-decorate, it is a little complicated to grasp what they do without trying yourself, but think of it more as a stylizing factor than a shape correction.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/Room_weight.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>It goes from Null to Heavy, while null does not use any of the stylistic information on the rendering, the heavy tries to hold more of the style when rendering the final image.</li>
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Redecorate/Room_weight.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Room Weight Exposure</code> : The Room Weight Exposure works similarly to the Shape Exposure but instead of influentiate the Shape Strenght it influentiates the Room Weight. The Room Weight Strenght controls the ammount of time that the Room Weight will influentiate the final render.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/Room_weight_style.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>The Slider goes from Weak to Strong, the weak represents the Room weight will run through 10% of the render time and the strong represents that it will run through the whole render time.</li>

			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Redecorate/room_style.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">  
			
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Shape Boost</code> :  The shape boost forces the AI to follow the shape of the room even more, it is an aditional neural network that works only on boosting the original shape on top of the original Shape Strenght.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/Shape_boost.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			
			<br>Choose from 1 to 5 choose how strong the boost will be.</li>

			<hr>

			<p><strong>OBS : </strong>This value can make your final render show only the original room, it is a delicate balance to reach perfect results and it requires some testing.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<li><code>Boost Exposure</code> : The Boost Exposure, as for other sorts of exposures relates to time, for how long the Shape boost will be present on the rendering process.
			<hr>
			<img src="assets/images/generative/Sliders/boost_exposure.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<hr>
			<br>Choose from 1 to 5 choose how long the boost will participate in the render time, being 1 = 10% and 5 = 50%.
			<hr>
